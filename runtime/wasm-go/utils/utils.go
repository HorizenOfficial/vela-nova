// Note: The TinyGo WASM module acts as a self-contained environment running on a single logical thread.
// Concurrency for calls to the WASM module must be handled on the host side (e.g., using Go's sync.Mutex
// in the calling Go code or better, using a single wasmtime.Instance for every call), as TinyGo's 'sync'
// package is not fully supported within the WASM environment for inter-module synchronization.

// allocatedMemory holds references to memory allocated by the guest, preventing the Go garbage
// collector from reclaiming it while it's in use by the host. The map key is the pointer address.

// TODO - When TinyGo compiles go into wasm, it configures the WebAssembly linear memory to an initial size
// of 2 pages (128KB), and marks a position in that memory as the heap base. All memory beyond that is used for the
// Go heap. Allocations within Go (compiled to %.wasm) are managed by calling memory.grow. The instruction is executed
// within the Wasm instance, but the actual memory growth happens in Wasmtime’s engine, which allocates more memory pages.
// A freeMap could be used to track memory blocks that have been freed and are available for reuse, avoiding the need
// to always request new memory pages from the WASM runtime, this is good for performances.
// The drawback is risk of mem fragmentation, and the fact that the application retains the maximum memory envelope
// it has ever needed.
